            <p>If you're like me, you probably have some coding projects you could be doing. But that shit can be really overwhelming.
                Where do you start? Whats the project going to be? Is it just a demo or is it actually functional? Are you going to release it to the public?
            </p>
            <p>But hey. Listen. You have to make something. So just start! It can't be that bad. Besides, who really sees your first few projects anyway? You
                can just make it private when you have evolved past the need for such primitive filler projects, or bury it somewhere in your machine "just in case"
                you ever need to look at it again.
